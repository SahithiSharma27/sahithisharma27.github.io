title: "Spontaneous cardiac tamponade associated with Dabigatran use"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-Cadiac Tamponade
excerpt: 'Dabigatran etexilate is a novel oral anticoagulant used in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolism. It is a direct thrombin inhibitor which reversibly blocks the catalytic site of thrombin and produces rapid anticoagulation within 2 hours. It has a pharmacokinetic profile that poduces predictable anticoagulation esponses and does not require frequent laboratory monitoring of clotting parameters. Dabigatran has the added advantage of an available reversal agentIdarucizumab. The commonly encountered adverse effects include bruising, minor bleeding acid-peptic disease and hepatobiliary disorders. Spontaneous hemopericardium and tamponade, is a rare and potentially fatal adverse effect of Dabigatran which entails immediate intervention.'
